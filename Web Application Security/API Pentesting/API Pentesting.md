### API Pentesting


notes: 
- OWASP [API](https://apisecurity.io/encyclopedia/content/owasp/owasp-api-security-top-10.htm) top 10
- 83% of the web traffic is API call traffic
- list for REST API endpoints SecList or [yassineaboukir](https://gist.github.com/yassineaboukir/8e12adefbd505ef704674ad6ad48743d)
- methods to fuzz if avaliable on the endpoint 
	- `GET-HEAD-POST-TRACE-OPTIONS-PUT`
- [[JWT attacks]] if the server uses JWT tokens
- manipulate requests/use repeated parameter 
- check path traversal if the API is in internal server `/api/v1/../../` 
- scan for [[prototype pollution]]
- read logs/commits of github 
- get travis-ci API endpoint from github account

##### [checklist](https://gitlab.com/pentest-tools/API-Security-Checklist)
- Authentication:
	- Don't use Basic Auth. Use standard authentication instead (e.g. JWT, OAuth).
	- Don't reinvent the wheel in Authentication, token generation, password storage.
	- Use the standards.
	- Use Max Retry and jail features in Login.
	- Use encryption on all sensitive data.

- JWT (JSON Web Token)
	- Use a random complicated key (JWT Secret) to make brute forcing the token very
	- hard.
	- Don't extract the algorithm from the header. Force the algorithm in the backend
	(HS256 or RS256).
	- Make token expiration (TTL, RTTL) as short as possible.
	- Don't store sensitive data in the JWT payload, it can be decoded easily.

- OAuth:
	- Always validate redirect_uri server-side to allow only whitelisted URLs.
	- Always try to exchange for code and not tokens (don't allow
	response_type=token).
	- Use state parameter with a random hash to prevent CSRF on the OAuth
	authentication process.
	- Define the default scope, and validate scope parameters for each application.
- Access:
	- Limit requests (Throttling) to avoid DDoS / brute-force attacks.
	- Use HTTPS on server side to avoid MITM (Man in the Middle Attack).
	- Use HSTS header with SSL to avoid SSL Strip attack.
	- For private APIs, only allow access from whitelisted IPs/hosts.
- Input
	- Use the proper HTTP method according to the operation: GET (read), POST
	(create), PUT/PATCH (replace/update), and DELETE (to delete a record), and respond
	with 405 Method Not Allowed if the requested method isn't appropriate for the
	requested resource.
	- Validate content-type on request Accept header (Content Negotiation) to allow
	only your supported format (e.g. application/xml, application/json, etc.) and respond
	with 406 Not Acceptable response if not matched.
	- Validate content-type of posted data as you accept (e.g. application/x-www-form-
	urlencoded, multipart/form-data, application/json, etc.).
	- Validate user input to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS, SQL-Injection,
	Remote Code Execution, etc.).
	- Don't use any sensitive data (credentials, Passwords, security tokens, or API keys)
	in the URL, but use standard Authorization header.
	- Use an API Gateway service to enable caching, Rate Limit policies (e.g. Quota,
	Spike Arrest, or Concurrent Rate Limit) and deploy APIs resources dynamically.
- Processing
	- Check if all the endpoints are protected behind authentication to avoid broken
	authentication process.
	- User own resource ID should be avoided. Use /me/orders instead of
	/user/654321/orders.
	- Don't auto-increment IDs. Use UUID instead.
	- If you are parsing XML files, make sure entity parsing is not enabled to avoid XXE
	(XML external entity attack).
	- If you are parsing XML files, make sure entity expansion is not enabled to avoid
	Billion Laughs/XML bomb via exponential entity expansion attack.
	- Use a CDN for file uploads.
	- If you are dealing with huge amount of data, use Workers and Queues to process
	as much as possible in background and return response fast to avoid HTTP Blocking.
	- Do not forget to turn the DEBUG mode OFF.
- Output
	- Send X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header.
	- Send X-Frame-Options: deny header.
	- Send Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none' header.
	- Remove fingerprinting headers - X-Powered-By, Server, X-AspNet-Version, etc.
	- Force content-type for your response. If you return application/json, then your
	content-type response is application/json.
	- Don't return sensitive data like credentials, Passwords, or security tokens.
	- Return the proper status code according to the operation completed. (e.g. 200 OK,
	400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 405 Method Not Allowed, etc.).
- CI & CD
	- Audit your design and implementation with unit/integration tests coverage.
	- Use a code review process and disregard self-approval.
	- Ensure that all components of your services are statically scanned by AV software
	before pushing to production, including vendor libraries and other dependencies.
	- Design a rollback solution for deployments.
